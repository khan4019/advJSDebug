	<h2>Path to be Manager</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>If you have a question. dont ask the question rather send an email. actually compose the email during office hours and send it at Sunday evening. Dont forget to CC your boss and some other upper level people who doesnt have any clue about the question</li>
		<li>if you have two questions, dont send email rather setup a meeting. Keep your boss optional in the meeting. He/she wont show up but will know u r doing a lot of stuff.</li>
		<li>if you need to setup a meeting with ur boss or some people higher than you. must setup the meeting either too early in the morning like 7.00am or after office hours like 6pm. That shows your dedication</li>
		<li>If you have to write one line of code. Make sure you have created a bug in your issue tracking system. you spend 5min to fix the bug and one hour to create the bug. update the bug and close it. what a productive day!</li>
		<li>if you have to write more than five lines of code. Creating an issue in Jira or any other issue tracking system isnt enough. you have to create a design meeting where everyone is a philosopher think about scalibility, security, readability where as code will suck anyway. set of unit tests, code review and spend three days to write those five lines of code</li>
